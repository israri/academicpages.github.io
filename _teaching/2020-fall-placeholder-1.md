### Basic of Calculus: Applications
Topics covered:
- Concepts of Rate of Change, Speed, and Growth
- Local Maxima and Minima and Concavity
- Tangent and Normal Line
  - to a curve
  - to circle, ellipse and parabola

I taught these concepts through [coding and function visualization (I used Wolfram Language with free account).](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/d72747e2-eb37-49de-8cbe-b4e8ecc456de)

### Introduction to Computational Science (4 Sessions)
Topics covered:
- Introduction to algorithm
  - Introducing the concept of algorithm through daily tasks
  - Concept of iteration
  - Examples: Sorting, random number generation and search algorithm for TSP problem
- Introduction to errors
  - Numerical, Syntax and Semantic Error

Obviously, these concepts are best introduced [through coding](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/5a79e1a4-54cf-4923-b76c-5841bd401615), but with such a short time to an audience with no programming background, it was a challenge on its own.
